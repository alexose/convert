QuickStrap - Thin wrapper around express.js executable to create express template site with twitter bootstrap
===============

Installation:
------

You can install it directly from npm:

    npm install -g quickstrap

Usage:
------

You use quickstrap much the same way you would use the express executable itself:

Example: quickstrap MySite -e

This would create an express site called MySite using EJS. Below are the options that express supports:

Options:

  -h, --help          output usage information <br />
  -V, --version       output the version number<br />
  -s, --sessions      add session support<br />
  -e, --ejs           add ejs engine support (defaults to jade) (in quickstrap this also adds support for [ejs-layouts](https://github.com/Soarez/express-ejs-layouts))<br />
  -J, --jshtml        add jshtml engine support (defaults to jade) (this actually doesn't work with Express 3.0, though quickstrap does add the files in the right place for future express releases)<br />
  -H, --hbs         add handlebars.js engine support (in express this is for Hogan, however in quickstrap this is for handlebars.js support)<br />
  -c, --css   add stylesheet  support (less|stylus) (defaults to plain css) (This will be supported in the future. For now only plain css is supported in quickstrap)<br />
  -f, --force         force on non-empty directory<br />

TODO:
------
  Add support for LESS <br />
  Add support for SASS <br />
  Add support for stylus <br />
  Clean up / add proper console output <br />
